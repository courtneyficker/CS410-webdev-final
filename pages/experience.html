        <p>I started at Intel with the creation of their new photomask fab at Ronler Acres in Hillsboro.
          I have had the opportunity to work in several modules within the fab, as well as coordinate
          training and other activities for my shift.

        <p>While I was a student here, I got to work in the Student Affairs division, providing technical
          support to the staff there. It was here that I was also given the opportunity to pursue side
          projects, and thus got my first exposure to <abbr title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr>
          and C#.

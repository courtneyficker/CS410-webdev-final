                Mainly it will help by querying a database I am keeping of all my tabletop
                miniatures, so I can find the one I need with ease. I am still working on that,
                but currently, it implements some web scraping techniques with Python that I have
                learned in my Web and Cloud Security class to check the websites of some gaming
                stores and pull their "daily deal" info, to save me the trouble of having to go
                check them myself every day.

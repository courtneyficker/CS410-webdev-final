                Miniature collection database</h6>
            <p class="card-text">
                When I first started buying miniatures for tabletop gaming, I thought an
                Excel spreadsheet would be more than adequate for my needs. Oh, how
                naive I was. My collection has exploded since then, so I have moved to a
                MySQL database. Using what I learned in CS 486 at PSU, I have had fun
                organizing and optimizing the structure and operation of the tables in
                my database..

                Sadly I have very little to show aside from my first initial foray into
                what will be a front end for the database. It doesn't actually search
                anything yet; it is solely a bit of tinkering with CSS to display search
                results.

                Lohrr is the name of a bot I've started making for Discord. Its purpose
                is to facilitate a <abbr title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&D</abbr> campaign
                I am planning. Mainly it will help by querying a database I am keeping of
                all my tabletop miniatures, so I can find the one I need with ease. I am
                still working on that, but currently, it implements some web scraping
                techniques with Python that I have learned in my Web and Cloud Security
                class to check the websites of some gaming stores and pull their "daily
                deal" info, to save me the trouble of having to go check them myself
                every day.

                I'm something of a digital hoarder, so I like to hang onto just about
                everything on any and all computers I have ever used. So I have kept
                these programs around in one form or another until I finally had the
                bright idea to upload them to GitHub for safekeeping. Some of them
                have sadly gotten corrupted over the years, but others are still as
                they were in the 90's on our 50 MHz family computer.
